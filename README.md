Abstract

This study analyzes public sentiment on the U.S. national debt in 2024 using discussions from Reddit's r/Economics subreddit. With the national debt reaching an unprecedented $35.46 trillion, the project explores prevailing attitudes, recurring themes, and the overall tone of public discourse. Data was collected using the Reddit API, cleaned, and preprocessed for analysis. Key methods included TF-IDF analysis to identify significant terms, topic modeling to uncover thematic patterns, and sentiment analysis using the VADER model to categorize comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

The results reveal a more balanced sentiment than anticipated. While 43.5% of comments conveyed optimism about fiscal strategies, economic growth, and debt management, 37.2% expressed concerns about sustainability and deficits, with the remaining 19.3% neutral. Key terms such as “debt,” “spending,” “growth,” and “tax” dominated the discourse, emphasizing themes of government spending, taxation policies, and economic recovery. Topic modeling further highlighted discussions on economic stability, borrowing, and future outlook.

These findings challenge the assumption of predominantly negative sentiment, revealing a nuanced public perspective. Future research should expand data sources, improve sentiment analysis tools, and explore demographic trends to gain a more comprehensive understanding of public attitudes toward fiscal policies.
